Use the following steps to import VistA from this source tree into a fresh M
environment to start a new VistA instance.  Assumptions:

- This source tree is checked out in a Git work tree

- A Python interpreter is available (tested with version 2.7)
  Visit http://www.python.org to obtain Python.

- An empty M database has been initialized and configured

  - InterSystems Cache: Configure a VISTA namespace to point at the empty
    database.  Add VistA's usual Routine and Global namespace mappings.

  - GT.M: Configure the database with maximum key size at least 512.
    Point the routine search path (gtmroutines) at an empty directory
    to hold the VistA routines.

Steps:

(1) Use Scripts/PackRO.py to pack all routines into routine transfer format:

 $ git ls-files -- "*.m" | python Scripts/PackRO.py > routines.ro

(2) Construct a file listing all global .zwr files:

 $ git ls-files -- "*.zwr" > globals.lst

(3) Use the M standard ^%RI routine to import routines:

 > D ^%RI
 Device: c:\path\to\VistA-FOIA\routines.ro

(4) Use the OSEHRA ^ZGI routine to import globals.  The $$LIST^ZGI function
    will read the list of files constructed above and append their names to
    the path specified in the second argument (note the trailing slash):

 > W $$LIST^ZGI("c:\path\to\VistA-FOIA\globals.lst","c:\path\to\VistA-FOIA\")

(5) Initialize VistA for this environment:

 > D ^ZTMGRSET

After the above steps the M database will contain VistA FOIA.
Proceed with normal VistA setup and configuration steps.
