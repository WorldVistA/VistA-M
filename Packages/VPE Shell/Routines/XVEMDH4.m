 ;;;    I         Allows you to select a field and display its data dictionary.
 ;;;
 ;;;   'n'        Entering a field's Reference number from the REF column, is a
 ;;;              shortcut method for displaying a field's data dictionary.
 ;;;
 ;;;  <TAB>       As noted above, you enter the REF number to select a field.
 ;;;              You may also select a field by positioning the highlight
 ;;;              located on the extreme left hand side of the screen, and then
 ;;;              hitting <TAB>.
 ;;;
 ;;;    D         Data display. In addition to the data dictionary, you may
 ;;;              look at the actual data in the file. After selecting a REF
 ;;;              number or range of numbers, you select the type of display
 ;;;              you want. You have the following choices:
 ;;;                         E  = External values
 ;;;                         I  = Internal values
 ;;;                         EN = External values, null fields ignored
 ;;;                         IN = Internal values, null fields ignored
 ;;;              You will then be asked which entry you want to see. If any
 ;;;              of the fields you requested are multiples, you will also be
 ;;;              asked which multiple entry you want to see.  After viewing
 ;;;              the data, you are returned to the Global Location screen.
 ;;;
 ;;;    F         Find a field. You will be prompted for a field name. Enter a
 ;;;              name or part of a name. VEDD will locate the field and position
 ;;;              it at the top of the display. If no field is found the screen
 ;;;              will be blank because you are at the end of the file. Use the
 ;;;              Up-Arrow key to scroll up and again display fields.
