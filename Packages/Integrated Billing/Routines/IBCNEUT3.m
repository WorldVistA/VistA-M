 ;;Per VA Directive 6402, this routine should not be modified.
 ;
 ; The purpose of the INSERROR utility is to identify a legitimate
 ; Insurance Company name, returning the associated Payer IEN and
 ; National ID.  This extrinsic function can receive either Insurance or
 ; Buffer data, identified as TYPE I or B, respectively.
 ;
 ; The former is the simpler case.  The IEN, in this case the Insurance
 ; IEN, is validated using the following criteria (some of which is
 ; validated in routine IBCNEUT4) :
 ;
 ; [1] Does it have a National ID?
 ; [2] Does the National ID have eIV defined?
 ; [3] Is the Payer active (i.e. the deactivated flag is turned off)
 ; [4] Is the national connection enabled?
 ; [5] Is the National ID blocked by VISTA?
 ;
 ; If all 5 criteria are met, the Payer IEN and National ID are
 ; returned.  If not, an error is generated and returned in ARRAY with
 ; information specific to the type of problem encountered.
 ;
 ; If the TYPE passed is B for Buffer, the IEN is the Buffer IEN.
 ; The Insurance Company name is retrieved from the Buffer file and
 ; leading and trailing spaces are stripped.  This value is compared to
 ; the entries in the "B" cross reference of the Insurance Company file
 ; (whose values have also been stripped of leading and trailing spaces).
 ; If a match (or several matches) is found,and a unique National ID is
 ; identified, confirm the 5 set of insurance validation criteria and
 ; process as above.
 ;
 ; If no match in the Insurance Company could be made, check the Auto
 ; Match file.  If a unique IEN is identified, confirm the 5 set of
 ; criteria stated above and process in kind.
 ;
 ; If no match could be established in both the Insurance Company and the
 ; Auto Match files, check the insurance company synonym file (stripping 
 ; off leading and trailing spaces) while preserving case sensitivity.
 ; If a unique Insurance Company could be identified, confirm the 5 set
 ; of validation criteria and process as above.

INSERROR(TYPE,IEN,ERRFLG,ARRAY) ;
 ; Formal parameters:
 ;  TYPE:   Type of IEN passed in the second parameter.
 ;          Either "B" for "Buffer" or "I" for "Insurance".
 ;          Mandatory, passed by value.
 ;  IEN:    IEN to perform a lookup for. Mandatory, passed by value.
 ;  ERRFLG: Error flag. "" or 0 if no extended error information is
 ;          requested, 1 if extended error information is requested.
 ;          Optional (the default is 0), passed by value.
 ;  ARRAY:  Array of error messages returned by the function.
 ;          Optional, passed by reference. Whatever is passed in will be
 ;          KILLed by the function. The structure of the return array is
 ;          as follows:
 ;          ARRAY         # of error messages passed back
 ;          ARRAY(error#) Data for this error number, including error
 ;          number 1 present in the value returned by the function.
 ;                [1]   IEN of the error code in the symbol file
 ;                [2]   # of lines in the error message text
 ;          ARRAY(error #,line #) - One line of error message text
 ;                                  up to 70 characters long
 ;
 ;          Returned value consists of the following "^"-delimited pcs:
 ;           [1]   The IEN of the IIV SYMBOL File (#365.15) entry for
 ;                 the first error condition encountered by the function.
 ;                 This is only present if a valid Payer was not found.
 ;           [2]   Payer IEN if a Payer was found, "" otherwise
 ;           [3]   National ID if a Payer was found
