AWAY Q  ;thought I was being figurative??? Guess again!
 ;
 ; This routine is for maintaining file entries in the IB UC VISIT TRACKING (#351.82) file across all treating facilites that a veteran has been seen at.
 ; So, while the file will not be the same at each facility, entries for a single veteran should match at each of his/her treating facilities.  
 ;
 ; Every time a record is added/updated in this file by a user, the UPDATED (#1.01) field is set.
 ; Nightly, this process will look for all the records in the file that have been updated.
 ; For each record that has been updated, this process will look for all the facilities a veteran has been treated at and execute a stored procedure (RPC) at each of those facilities
 ; to update their file.  If successful at all of the veteran's treating facilities, the UPDATED field will be removed.
 ; If not successful, the record will remain flagged to indicate that it needs to be tried again at a later time. 
 ;
 ; There are multiple calling entry points
 ; UPDATED - pretty much the process described above.
 ; DFN - synch the entries for one veteran across her/his treating facilities.  This one is used when a veteran gets treated at a new facility and the new facility need to get
 ;       caught up
 ; PULLTHEM - This is used when a veteran is seen at a new treatiing facility.  It reaches out to each of the treating facilities and requests that all the veterans file entries that
 ;       were created at a facility to be sent to the new one.
 ;
 ;  High level process flow
 ; 1) get all the records that you want to update (either by UPDATED flag or DFN)
 ; 2) loop through those and for each, get the veteran and his/her treating facilities
 ; 3) loop through treating facilities and executing remote RPC passing in the information about the specific entry
 ; 4) wait a reasonable amount on time for results from the remote treating facilities
 ; 5) remove from index if successful
 ; 6) rinse, repeat
 ;
UPDATED ; Get all in File that were UPDATED and not yet pushed out. They may have gotten to some sites but not all sites
 ; 
 D MULTI("AC",1)   ; "AC" index for updated (1's) records
 Q
 ;
 ; This was set up to pass in 1 regular index and an internal lookup value which it does an exact match on.
 ; This leads to the most efficient database call acording to the FileMan manual (didn't actually run performance tests)
 ; Any changes to this behavior would need to be tested/verified and potentially recoded.
MULTI(IBINDEX,IBLOOKUP) ;
 ; IBINDEX = a single regular fileman index
 ; IBLOOKUP = internal value for that index
