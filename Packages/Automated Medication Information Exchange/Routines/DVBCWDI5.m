 ;;E. Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;      1.  State whether the veteran has diabetes mellitus.  Indicate type.
 ;;      2.  Specifically list each identified complication of the veteran's
 ;;          diabetes.  Indicate these conditions as complications of the
 ;;          veteran's diabetes. If the veteran has peripheral edema,
 ;;          indicate whether it is a consequence of diabetic kidney disease
 ;;          or other non-diabetic related etiology.
 ;;      3.  For each identified complication of the veteran's diabetes,
 ;;          provide a brief rationale for your conclusion.  You may base
 ;;          your rationale on such things as the duration of the veteran's
 ;;          diabetes, whether the veteran's diabetes has been poorly
 ;;          controlled, the onset of the condition that you deem to be a
 ;;          complication of the veteran's diabetes in relation to the onset
 ;;          of the veteran's diabetes, the severity of the complication, or
 ;;          anything else you consider relevant.
 ;;      4.  Where the veteran has visual impairment, cardiovascular disease
 ;;          (including hypertension), kidney disease, neurologic disease,
 ;;          amputations, or any other disabilities which, in your opinion,
 ;;          are not complications of the veteran's diabetes, please state so
 ;;          and provide a supporting rationale as to the basis for your
 ;;          conclusion.
 ;;      5.  Where the veteran has a condition that is worsened or increased
 ;;          by the veteran's diabetes but may or may not be a diabetic
 ;;          complication, discuss the relationship between the condition and
 ;;          the veteran's diabetes. In particular, describe the baseline
 ;;          disability and the additional manifestations of the disability
 ;;          that was aggravated/worsened by diabetes.  Provide your rationale.
 ;;          Indicate if this is not possible to do without resorting to
 ;;          speculation.
