 ;;Narrative: The potential residuals of traumatic brain injury necessitate a
 ;;comprehensive examination to document all disabling effects.  Specialist
 ;;examinations, such as eye and audio examinations, mental disorder
 ;;examinations, and others, may also be needed in some cases, as indicated
 ;;below.  If possible, conduct a thorough review of the service and post-service
 ;;medical records prior to the examination.
 ;;
 ;;Health care providers who may conduct TBI examinations:
 ;;Physicians who are specialists in Physiatry, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and
 ;;Psychiatry and who have training and experience with Traumatic Brain Injury
 ;;may conduct TBI examinations.  The expectation is that the physician would
 ;;have demonstrated expertise, regardless of specialty, through baseline training
 ;;(residency) and/or subsequent training and demonstrated experience.  In
 ;;addition, a nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, or a physician
 ;;assistant, if they are clinically privileged to perform activities required
 ;;for C&P TBI examinations, and have evidence of expertise through training
 ;;and demonstrated experience, may conduct TBI examinations under close
 ;;supervision of a board-certified or board-eligible physiatrist, neurologist,
 ;;or psychiatrist.
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    1. Report date(s) and nature of injury.
 ;;    2. State severity rating of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at time of injury.
 ;;    3. State whether condition has stabilized.  If not, provide estimate of
 ;;       when stability may be expected (typically within 18-24 months of initial
 ;;       injury).
 ;;    4. Inquire specifically about each symptom or area of symptoms below,
 ;;       since individuals with TBI may have difficulty organizing and
 ;;       communicating their symptoms without prompting.  It is important to
 ;;       document all problems, whether subtle or pronounced, so that the
 ;;       veteran can be appropriately evaluated for all disabilities due to
 ;;       TBI.
 ;;
 ;;For each of the following symptoms that is present, answer specific questions
 ;;asked.

 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
 ;;
 ;;    1. Motor function.  Report the motor strength of the affected muscles of
 ;;       all areas of weakness or paralysis using the standard muscle grading
 ;;       scale, for example, weakness of flexion of left elbow (3/5 strength
 ;;       for flexors), complete paralysis of left lower extremity (0/5 for all
 ;;       muscle groups).  To the extent possible, identify the peripheral
 ;;       nerves that innervate the weakened or paralyzed muscles, even when
 ;;       the weakness or paralysis is of central origin.
 ;;
 ;;       Standard muscle grading scale:
 ;;
 ;;       0 = Absent  No muscle movement felt.
 ;;       1 = Trace  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but no movement produced.
 ;;       2 = Poor  Muscle movement produced only with gravity eliminated.
 ;;       3 = Fair  Muscle movement produced against gravity, but cannot
 ;;           overcome any resistance.
 ;;       4 = Good  Muscle movement produced against some resistance, but not
 ;;           against "normal" resistance.
 ;;       5 = Normal  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.
 ;;
 ;;    2. Muscle tone, reflexes.  Describe any muscle atrophy or loss of muscle
 ;;       tone.  Examine and report deep tendon reflexes and any pathological
 ;;       reflexes.
 ;;    3. Sensory function.  Describe exact location of any area of abnormal
 ;;       sensory function.  State which modalities of sensation were tested.
 ;;       Identify the peripheral nerve(s) that innervate the areas with
 ;;       abnormal sensation.
 ;;    4. Gait, spasticity, cerebellar signs.  Describe any gait abnormality,
 ;;       imbalance, tremor or fasciculations, incoordination, or spasticity.
 ;;       If there is spasticity or rigidity, assess any limitation of motion
 ;;       of joint (including joint contracture) by following the Joints
 ;;       examination protocol.  (A tandem gait assessment (walking in a
 ;;       straight line with one foot directly in front of the other) is
 ;;       recommended).
 ;;    5. Autonomic nervous system.  Describe any other impairment of the
 ;;       autonomic nervous system, such as orthostatic (postural) hypotension
 ;;       (if present, state if associated with dizziness or syncope on
 ;;       standing), hyperhidrosis, delayed gastric emptying, heat intolerance,
 ;;       etc.
 ;;    6. Cranial nerves.  Conduct a screening exam for cranial nerve impairment.
 ;;       If positive, follow Cranial Nerve examination protocol.
 ;;    7. Cognitive impairment.  Conduct a screening examination (such as the
 ;;       Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) or Mini-Mental State Examination
 ;;       (MMSE) to assess cognitive impairment and report results and their
 ;;       significance.  Does the screening show problems with memory,
 ;;       concentration, attention, executive functions, etc.?  If yes,
 ;;       neuropsychological testing to confirm the presence and extent of
 ;;       cognitive impairment is needed, unless already conducted and of
 ;;       record.  Include test results in the examination report.
 ;;    8. Psychiatric manifestations.  Conduct a screening examination for
 ;;       psychiatric manifestations, including neurobehavioral effects.  If a
 ;;       mental disorder is suggested, request a mental disorder exam or
 ;;       PTSD exam, as appropriate, by a mental disease specialist.
 ;;    9. Vision and hearing screening examinations (if abnormalities are
 ;;       found, or there are symptoms or a claim of eye or ear impairment,
 ;;       request an eye or audio exam by a specialist).
 ;;   10. Skin.  Describe any areas of skin breakdown due to neurologic problems.
