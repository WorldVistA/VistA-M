 ;  Adding or Editing of data in a particular field can be controlled
 ;by adding a ~ as a delimiter and the letters A and/or E to the
 ;end of the line of text which represents what could be added
 ;to the DR string in a DIE call.
 ; 1. If none or all three(~AE) of these characters are added then
 ;    the data in this field can be either added or edited.
 ; 2. If only the ~ is added then the data in this field can be
 ;    neither added or edited.
 ; 3. IF only the ~A is added then the data can only be added to
 ;    the file for this field but not edited.
 ; 4. If only the ~E is added the data can only be edited in
 ;    this file for this field. (not a likely possibility)
 ;
 ; The word "OPTION" in front of the line of text below tells the 
 ;software to determine, based on the data, the appropriateness
 ;of using either a "///" or "////" stuff in a DIE call.
 ;
 ; The information on line tag 0 $P(,," * ",1) are the piece numbers
 ;of the fields on the zero node that are required by the data
 ;dictionary and are checked for to determine if enough data is present
 ;to proceed without any errors. $P(,," * ",2) are the nodes and
 ;piece numbers of the fields used to determine duplicates in the
 ;file (node+piece (eg. 12+4)). $P(,," * ",3) is a flag use to
 ;determine if duplicates are allowed in this visit file. 
 ;If it is set to 0 then no duplicate checks will occur. If it is
 ;set to 1 then the file will be checked for duplicates based on
 ;the information in $P 2.
 ;
 ; The following is the file's global name.  Each global must have a
 ;unique name and cannot have any subscripts as part of the global root.
