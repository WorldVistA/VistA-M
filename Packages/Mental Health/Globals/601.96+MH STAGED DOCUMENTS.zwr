If there are discrepancies in ratings from the informant and the patient interviews, the rater should re-interview both the informant and the patient with the goal to resolve the discrepancies.The final ratings of the CSDD items represent the rater's clinical impression rather than the responses of the informant or the patient. The semi-structured interviews can be found at the Geriatric Mental Health Site on the VHA Pulse or by contacting the Mental Health Program Office."", "
