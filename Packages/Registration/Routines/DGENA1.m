LOCK(DFN) ;
 ;Description: This lock is used to prevent another process from editing
 ;     a patient's enrollment, including the current enrollment and the
 ;     enrollment history.
 ;Input:
 ;  DFN - Patient IEN
 ;Output:
 ;  Function Value - Returns 1 if the lock was successful, 0 otherwise
 ;
 I $G(DFN) L +^DPT("ENROLLMENT",DFN):10
 Q $T
UNLOCK(DFN) ;
 ;Description: Used to release a lock created by $$LOCK.
 ;Input:
 ;  DFN - Patient IEN
 ;Output: None

STORE(DGENR,NOCHECK,ERRMSG) ;
 ;Description: Used to file a PATIENT ENROLLMENT record.  Consistency
 ;     checks are done unless NOCHECK=1.If the
 ;     enrollment passes the consistency checks specified the
 ;     PATIENT ENROLLMENT record will be created and the ien returned.
 ;     If the consistency checks are not passed, or a record can not
 ;     be created, 0 is returned. This call does NOT lock the record - 
 ;     call LOCK prior to STORE if the record needs to be locked. 
 ;Input :
 ;  DGENR - this local array represents a PATIENT ENROLLMENT (pass by reference)
 ;  NOCHECK - a flag, if NOCHECK=1 it means the consistency checks were done already, so do not do them again. (optional)
 ;  ERRMSG - error message on failure (optional, pass by reference)
 ;Output:
 ;  Function Value - returns the ien of the PATIENT ENROLLMENT record
 ;     created if successful , 0 otherwise

 ;Description: Used to store an enrollment that has already been created

 ;     consistency checks specified the enrollment record will be

 ;Input :
 ;  DGENR - this local array represents a PATIENT ENROLLMENT and should

 ;  NOCHECK - a flag, if NOCHECK=1 it means the consistency checks were done already, so do not do them again. (optional)
 ;Output:
 ;  Function Value - returns the internal entry number of the PATIENT
 ;     ENROLLMENT record created if successful , 0 otherwise

EDITCUR(DGENR) ;
 ;Description: Used to store an enrollment that has already been created
 ;     as a local array  into  the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file as the
 ;     patient's current enrollment. If the enrollment passes the
 ;     consistency checks specified the current enrollment record, if
 ;     it exists, will be overlaid by the enrollment contained in
 ;     DGENR, otherwise, if there is no current enrollment, a new
 ;     patient enrollment record will be created as the current
 ;     enrollment. If the consistency checks are not passed, or a
 ;     record can not be created, NULL will be returned.
 ;Input :
 ;  DGENR - this local array represents a PATIENT ENROLLMENT and
 ;     should be passed by reference.
 ;Output:
 ;  Function Value - returns the internal entry number of the PATIENT
