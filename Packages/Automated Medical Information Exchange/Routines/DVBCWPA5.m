 ;;   12.  CARDIAC:  Record heart sounds, including any extra heart sounds,
 ;;        rhythm, PMI.  Indicate if there is evidence of congestive heart
 ;;        failure or pulmonary hypertension.  (NOTE:  A determination of METs
 ;;        by exercise testing may be required for certain cardiovascular
 ;;        conditions, and an estimation of METs may be required if exercise
 ;;        testing cannot be conducted for medical reasons.  If there is evidence
 ;;        of a cardiovascular condition, or one is claimed, refer to appropriate
 ;;        worksheets.).
 ;;
 ;;   13.  ABDOMEN/GASTROINTESTINAL:  Report abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, mass,
 ;;        tenderness, guarding, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, etc.  If there is a
 ;;        hernia, describe type, location, size, whether complete, reducible,
 ;;        recurrent, supported by truss or belt, and whether or not operable.
 ;;        If there are hemorrhoids, state whether they are internal or external,
 ;;        whether bleeding or prolapse (state whether reducible) is present, and
 ;;        whether thrombosis or fissure is present.  If there are periods of
 ;;        incapacitation due to a gastrointestinal condition, state total number
 ;;        of days of incapacitation (requiring bedrest and treatment by a
 ;;        physician) during the past 12-month period.
 ;;
 ;;   14.  GENITOURINARY:  For males, report abnormality of penis, testicles,
 ;;        epididymis, seminal vesicles, spermatic cord and prostate gland.
 ;;        Include rectal examination.  For males and females, if there is a
 ;;        urinary fistula, describe extent of leakage and need for catheter or
 ;;        number of absorbent pads required per day.
 ;;   
 ;;   15.  GYNECOLOGIC:  Report abnormality on pelvic examination of labia,
 ;;        introitus, vagina, cervix, uterus, adnexa and ovaries.  Perform Pap
 ;;        smear (if none within past year).  If unable to conduct an examination
 ;;        and Pap smear, or if there is a severe or complex problem, refer to a
 ;;        specialist.
 ;;
 ;;   16.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  If there is limitation of motion of one or more
 ;;        joints, a detailed assessment of each affected joint is required.
 ;;        Using a goniometer, measure the active range of motion in degrees.
 ;;        State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.  After at
 ;;        least 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there are
 ;;        additional limitations of range of motion and whether there is
 ;;        objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most important
 ;;        factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance, incoordination)
 ;;        for any additional loss of motion after repetitive motion.  Report
 ;;        the range of motion after the repetitions.  (See the appropriate
 ;;        musculoskeletal worksheet (feet, spine, etc.) for more details.)
 ;;
 ;;        Describe spasm, atrophy, or other muscle abnormalities.  For atrophy,
 ;;        report measurements bilaterally.  Report any loss of muscle strength
 ;;        using the standard muscle strength grading system (0 = absent.  No
 ;;        muscle movement felt; 1 = trace.  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but
 ;;        no movement produced; 2 = poor.  Muscle movement produced only with
 ;;        gravity eliminated; 3 = fair.  Muscle movement produced against
 ;;        gravity but cannot overcome resistance; 4 = good.  Muscle movement
 ;;        produced against some resistance, but not against "normal" resistance;
 ;;        5 = normal.  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.).
 ;;
 ;;        If there has been a fracture, describe location and any residuals,
 ;;        such as malunion, deformity, ankylosis, etc.  If there has been an
 ;;        amputation, follow the Residuals of Amputation worksheet.
 ;;
 ;;        If foot problems exist, also report painful motion, swelling, callus,
 ;;        tenderness, instability, weakness, spasm, rigidity, and circulatory
 ;;        disturbance.  Report foot or toe deformities such as pes cavus,
 ;;        hammertoes, or hallux valgus.  If there is flatfoot:  report whether
 ;;        there is pronation; the status of the arch; whether the weight bearing
 ;;        line is over or medial to the great toe; the Achilles, forefoot, and
 ;;        midfoot alignment; whether there is pain at rest or on manipulation;
 ;;        and whether a malalignment is correctable by manipulation.
 ;;
 ;;   17.  EXTREMITIES:  Describe abnormalities such as ulcers, cyanosis,
 ;;        clubbing, stasis dermatitis, gangrene, trophic changes, varicose veins,
 ;;        calf tenderness, edema, and decreased or absent pulses.  If there is
 ;;        edema, is it relieved by elevation of extremities?
 ;;
 ;;   18.  ENDOCRINE:  Describe neck mass or nodule, lid lag or exophthalmos,
 ;;        abnormalities of hair or skin, or abnormalities of other body systems
 ;;        due to endocrine disease.
 ;; 
 ;;   19.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Assess orientation and memory, gait, stance, and 
 ;;        coordination, speech, cranial nerve functions.  Assess deep tendon
 ;;        reflexes, pain, touch, temperature, vibration, and position, motor and
 ;;        sensory status of peripheral nerves.  If neurological abnormalities
 ;;        are found on examination, or there is a history of seizures, refer to
 ;;        appropriate worksheet.
 ;;
 ;;   20.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Describe affect, mood, judgment, behavior, comprehension
 ;;        of commands, hallucinations or delusions, and intelligence.  This is
 ;;        meant to be a brief screening examination.  If a mental disorder is
 ;;        claimed, or suspected based on the screening examination, request a
 ;;        mental disorder or PTSD examination conducted by a specialist.
 ;;
 ;;   21.  BREAST:  Describe mass or diffuse nodularity, nipple abnormalities,
 ;;        gynecomastia, residuals of surgery, axillary lymphadenopathy, and skin
 ;;        abnormalities.  Report whether there is a significant difference in
 ;;        size or contour between the breasts.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic And Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the
 ;;        examination report.
 ;;    2.  Review all test results before providing the summary and diagnosis.
 ;;    3.  Follow additional worksheets, as appropriate.
 ;;    4.  Request tests as indicated - e.g., parasite studies, X-rays of joints,
 ;;        etc.  The diagnosis of degenerative or traumatic arthritis of any
 ;;        joint requires X-ray confirmation, but once confirmed by X-ray, either
 ;;        in service or after service, no further X-rays of that joint are
 ;;        required for disability evaluation purposes.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  All laboratory and diagnostic tests should be completed and reviewed
 ;;        prior to completing the summary of findings.
 ;;    2.  The POW Physician Coordinator should complete summary of findings,
 ;;        diagnoses, and recommendations.  The Coordinator should also express
 ;;        an opinion, with supporting reasons, concerning the relationship
 ;;        between the veteran's experiences as a POW and each current medical
 ;;        condition.  If osteoarthritis is diagnosed, it should be clarified
 ;;        whether this is post-traumatic osteoarthritis, and, if so, whether it
 ;;        is related to the period of confinement.
 ;;    3.  State whether any specialist examinations are indicated and whether
 ;;        any have been requested.
 ;;    4.  For each condition diagnosed, describe its effect on the veteran's
 ;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
 ;;    5.  CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS:  Mental competency, for VA
 ;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
 ;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to
 ;;        any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
 ;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
 ;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
 ;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
 ;;        competency, please address the following:
 ;;
 ;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
 ;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
 ;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
 ;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
 ;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
 ;;        himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
 ;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
 ;;        support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
 ;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
 ;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
