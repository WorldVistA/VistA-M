 ;;NOTE:  To clarify Item VII above:  "Instrumental activities of daily living"
 ;;       refers to activities other than self-care that are needed for
 ;;       independent living, such as meal preparation, doing housework, and other
 ;;       chores, shopping, traveling, doing laundry, being responsible for one's
 ;;       own medications, and using a telephone.  These activities are
 ;;       distinguished from "Activities of daily living", which refer to basic
 ;;       self-care and include bathing or showering, dressing, eating, getting
 ;;       in or out of bed or a chair, and using the toilet.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1. Skull X-rays to measure bony defect, if any, due to surgery or injury.
 ;;    2. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the
 ;;       examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    1. List each diagnosis.
 ;;    2. Capacity to manage financial affairs
 ;;       Mental competency, for VA benefits purposes, refers only to the ability
 ;;       of the veteran to manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best
 ;;       interest, and not to any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA
 ;;       benefits purposes, means that the veteran, because of injury or disease,
 ;;       is not capable to managing benefit payments in his or her own best
 ;;       interest.  In order to assist raters in making a legal determination
 ;;       as to competency, please address the following:
 ;;
 ;;       a. What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
 ;;          manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
 ;;          things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
 ;;          knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
 ;;          the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle money and pay the
 ;;          bills himself or herself?
 ;;       b. Based on your examination, do you believe the veteran is capable of
 ;;          managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
 ;;          support your conclusion.  If you believe a Social Work Service
 ;;          assessment is needed before you can give your opinion on the
 ;;          veteran's ability to manage his or her financial affairs, please
 ;;          explain why.
 ;;
 ;;    3. Note:  When a mental disorder is present, state, or ask the mental
 ;;       disorders examiner to state, to the extent possible, which
 ;;       emotional/behavior signs and symptoms are part of a co-morbid mental
 ;;       disorder and which represent residuals of TBI.  If it is impossible to
 ;;       make such a determination without speculation, so state.
