 ;;Narrative:  The potential residuals of traumatic brain injury necessitate
 ;;a comprehensive examination to document all disabling effects.  Specialist
 ;;examinations, such as eye and audio examinations, mental disorder
 ;;examinations, and others, may also be needed in some cases, as indicated
 ;;below.  If possible, conduct a thorough review of the service and post-
 ;;service medical records prior to the examination.

 ;;      of when stability may be expected (typically within 18-24 months of
 ;;      initial injury).
 ;;
 ;;   Inquire specifically about each symptom or area of symptoms below, since
 ;;   individuals with TBI may have difficulty organizing and communicating
