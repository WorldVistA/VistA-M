 ;;Narrative: This is the protocol for conducting initial examinations on former 
 ;;POWs.  Approach these veterans with the greatest sensitivity because the 
 ;;POW experience likely resulted in a great deal of psychological and physical 
 ;;trauma.  Details about beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, 
 ;;disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, and anxiety may be 
 ;;significant parts of the veteran's history; eliciting these details requires  
 ;;that one establish a trusting relationship with the veteran. Examine
 ;;veteran for each disability / disease / condition veteran is claiming 
 ;;as a consequence of the POW experience.  A former POW may be entitled 
 ;;to service connection for presumptive POW diseases; the worksheet contains
 ;;a list of these presumptive diseases.  Based on veteran's claim(s) and your
 ;;findings, please refer to and follow additional worksheets to assure
 ;;the examination  provides information adequate for rating purposes.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;PRESUMPTIVE POW DISABILITIES: 
 ;;
 ;;If a veteran is a former prisoner of war, the following diseases shall be
 ;;service connected if manifest to a degree of disability of 10 percent or more
 ;;at any time after service:
 ;;
 ;;   - Psychosis.
 ;;   - Any of the anxiety states.
 ;;   - Dysthymic disorder (or depressive neurosis).
 ;;   - Organic residuals of frostbite, if it is determined that the veteran was
 ;;     interned in climatic conditions consistent with the occurrence of
 ;;     frostbite.

 ;;   - Atherosclerotic heart disease or hypertensive vascular disease (including
 ;;     hypertensive heart disease) and their complications (including myocardial
 ;;     infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia).
 ;;   - Stroke and its complications.
 ;;   - On or after October 10, 2008, Osteoporosis, if the Secretary determines
 ;;     that the veteran has posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
 ;;
 ;;If a veteran is a former prisoner of war and was interned or detained for not
 ;;less than 30 days, the following diseases shall be service connected if

 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;

 ;;        History, which the veteran should have completed, prior to 
 ;;        conducting the examination.

 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):  NOTE:  If the veteran 
 ;;    has had a previous protocol examination, only an interval history
 ;;    is required.

 ;;        they result in additional limitation of motion or other functional
 ;;        impairments during the flare-up.

 ;;        release weights.
 ;;    8.  Describe initial symptoms, time of onset, course, and current symptoms
 ;;        of all presumptive POW disabilities found.

 ;;        b. Location of neoplasm.
 ;;        c. Types and dates of treatment.

 ;;           expected date of completion.
 ;;
 ;;    11. Conduct a complete system review, with a focus on symptoms related to

 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings.
 ;;    Report any other significant physical abnormalities.  The examiner should
 ;;    incorporate all ancillary study results into the final diagnoses.
 ;;
 ;;    1.  GENERAL:  Pulse, respirations, height, weight, maximum weight in past
 ;;        year, percentage of weight change in past year compared to baseline
 ;;        (average weight in the 2 years preceding onset of disease), body build,
 ;;        and state of nutrition.
 ;;
 ;;    2.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  (Per the rating schedule, hypertension means that the
 ;;        diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and
 ;;        isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure
 ;;        is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of
 ;;        less than 90mm.).
 ;;
 ;;        i.  If the diagnosis of hypertension has not been previously
 ;;            established, and it is a claimed issue, B.P. readings must be
 ;;            taken two or more times on each of at least three different days.
 ;;       ii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed and is claimed, but
 ;;            the claimant is not on treatment, B.P. readings must be taken two
 ;;            or more times on at least three different days.
 ;;      iii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed, and the claimant is
 ;;            on treatment, take three blood pressure readings on the day of the
 ;;            examination.
 ;;       iv.  If hypertension has not been claimed, take three blood pressure
 ;;            readings on the day of the examination.  If they are suggestive of
 ;;            hypertension or are borderline, readings must be taken two or more
 ;;            times on at least two additional days to rule hypertension in or
 ;;            out.
 ;;        v.  In the diagnostic summary, state whether hypertension is ruled in
 ;;            or out after completing these B.P. measurements.  If hypertensive
 ;;            heart disease is suspected or found, follow worksheet for Heart.
 ;;
 ;;    3.  POSTURE AND GAIT:  Describe if abnormal.
 ;;
 ;;    4.  SKIN:  If abnormal, describe appearance, location, extent of rash or

 ;;        loss, adherence, color difference, and whether there is tenderness, 
 ;;        skin breakdown, or functional limitation of activity or motion due to
 ;;        the scarring.  If there are scars, including burn scars, or other
 ;;        disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, follow the Scars worksheet.
 ;;        (NOTE:  If there are disfiguring scars of the head, face, or neck,
 ;;        obtain and submit COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS of the affected area(s).  Report
 ;;        nail abnormalities).
