 ;;Narrative:  In some cases, assessment of the residuals of brain or spinal
 ;;cord disease or injury will require following examination worksheets in other
 ;;body systems or referring for a specialist examination (for Eye, Hearing,
 ;;or Mental Disorders).  For example, bladder impairment may require assessment
 ;;under the Genitourinary worksheet guidelines.  Vision problems will require a
 ;;specialist eye examination.  Other examination worksheets for the nervous
 ;;system (cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, epilepsy and narcolepsy) may need
 ;;to be followed for thorough assessment.
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:  Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):

 ;;    1.  History of surgery or hospitalizations, reason or type of surgery,
 ;;        location and dates, if known.
 ;;    2.  History of trauma to brain or spinal cord.  If there is a history of
 ;;        traumatic brain injury in service, follow the Traumatic Brain Injury
 ;;        worksheet.

 ;;        leakage, urinary incontinence, leakage due to surgical urinary
 ;;        diversion, stress incontinence, etc.), requirement for constant or
 ;;        intermittent catheterization or use of an appliance, wearing of
 ;;        absorbent material (number of times that must be changed daily).

 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  If a neoplasm is or was present, describe residuals of the neoplasm
 ;;        and its treatment.
 ;;    2.  Describe specific functional motor impairment of affected areas (for
 ;;        example, weakness of flexion of left elbow (3/5 strength for flexors),
 ;;        complete paralysis (0/5) of all muscle groups of left lower extremity).
 ;;        Use standard muscle strength grading system:  0 = absent.  No muscle
 ;;        movement felt; 1 = trace.  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but no
 ;;        movement produced; 2 = poor.  Muscle movement produced only with
 ;;        gravity eliminated; 3 = fair.  Muscle movement produced against
 ;;        gravity but cannot overcome resistance; 4 = good.  Muscle movement
 ;;        produced against some resistance, but not against "normal" resistance;
 ;;        5 = normal.  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.
 ;;    3.  Describe abnormality of muscle tone and any muscle atrophy (give left
 ;;        and right side measurements).
 ;;    4.  Reflexes.  Use deep tendon reflex grading system (0 = absent, 1+ =
 ;;        hypoactive, 2+ = normal, 3+ = hyperactive, without clonus, 4+ =
 ;;        hyperactive, with clonus).  Report bilateral reflexes of biceps (C5-6),
 ;;        triceps (C6-8), brachioradialis (C5-6), finger jerk (C8-T1), abdominal
 ;;        (T8-T12), knee jerk (L3-4), ankle jerk (S1), plantar (Babinski).
 ;;    5.  If there is loss of sensory function of a nerve or group of nerves,
 ;;        report the location, modality of sensation affected, and whether
 ;;        decreased or absent.
 ;;    6.  If cranial nerve function is affected, follow the Cranial Nerves
 ;;        worksheet.
 ;;    7.  Describe in detail any functional impairment of the autonomic nervous
 ;;        system.
 ;;    8.  If there is limitation of motion of one or more joints, a detailed
 ;;        assessment of each affected joint is required.
 ;;
 ;;        Using a goniometer, measure the active range of motion in degrees.
 ;;        State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.  After
 ;;        at least 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there
 ;;        are additional limitations of range of motion and whether there is
 ;;        objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most important
 ;;        factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance, incoordination)
 ;;        for any additional loss of motion after repetitive motion.  Report
 ;;        the range of motion after the repetitions.  (See the appropriate
 ;;        musculoskeletal worksheet for more details.).
 ;;    9.  If there is speech impairment, state to what extent veteran is able
 ;;        to be understood (unable to be understood, able to be understood less
 ;;        than half the time, able to be understood half of the time or more
 ;;        but not always, able to be understood all of the time except for a
 ;;        few words or only occasionally not understood).
 ;;    10. Describe any psychiatric or cognitive manifestations in detail - see
 ;;        worksheets for mental disorders (but when traumatic brain injury is
 ;;        present, also see the Traumatic Brain Injury worksheet to assess
 ;;        cognitive impairment).
 ;;    11. Describe tremors or fasciculation, gait, balance, cerebellar signs.
 ;;    12. Eye examination - follow Eye worksheet.  Requires specialist to
 ;;        conduct examination if there are eye complaints or findings.
 ;;    13. State if the veteran has bladder or bowel functional impairment.  For
 ;;        bowel impairment, state whether leakage is evident and the status of
 ;;        the sphincter (normal, decreased tone, absent tone).  For bladder
 ;;        impairment, state whether leakage is evident and describe any
 ;;        complications (follow the Genitourinary worksheet if indicated).
 ;;    14. If smell or taste is affected, also complete the worksheet for Sense
 ;;        of Smell and Taste.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Skull X-rays to measure bony defect, if there was surgery; 
 ;;        spine X-rays if there was spinal cord surgery.
 ;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  State diagnosis or diagnoses.
 ;;    2.  For each condition diagnosed, describe the effects on the veteran's
 ;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
 ;;    3.  Capacity to Manage Financial Affairs:  Mental competency, for VA
 ;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
 ;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to
 ;;        any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
 ;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
 ;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
 ;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
 ;;        competency, please address the following:
 ;;
 ;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
 ;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
 ;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
 ;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
 ;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
 ;;        himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
 ;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
 ;;        support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
 ;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
 ;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
