 ;;Narrative:  Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized
 ;;by debilitating fatigue and several flu-like symptoms.  It may have 
 ;;both physical and psychiatric manifestations and closely resembles 
 ;;neurasthenia, neurocirculatory asthenia, fibrositis, or fibromyalgia. 
 ;;
 ;;   FOR VA PURPOSES, A DIAGNOSIS OF CFS MUST MEET BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
 ;;
 ;;   1.  New onset of debilitating fatigue that is severe enough to 
 ;;       reduce or impair average daily activity below 50 percent of the
 ;;       patient's pre-illness activity level for a period of 6 months, and
 ;;   2.  Other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms 
 ;;       must be excluded by thorough evaluation, based on history, 
 ;;       physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.
 ;;
 ;;   IT MUST ALSO MEET SIX OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING TEN CRITERIA:
 ;;
 ;;   1.  Describe in detail:
 ;;
 ;;       a.  Acute onset of the condition.
 ;;       b.  Low grade fever.
 ;;       c.  Nonexudative pharyngitis.
 ;;       d.  Palpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes.
 ;;       e.  Generalized muscle aches or weakness.
 ;;       f.  Fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise.
 ;;       g.  Headaches (of a type, severity or pattern that is different
 ;;           from headaches in the premorbid state).
 ;;       h.  Migratory joint pains.
 ;;       i.  Neuropsychologic symptoms.
 ;;       j.  Sleep disturbance.
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Date diagnosis established.
 ;;    2.  Does it meet the requirements outlined above?
 ;;    3.  History of hospitalizations or surgery, reason or type of surgery,
 ;;        location and dates, if known.
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Estimate the percentage of restriction of routine daily activities,
 ;;        including employment if applicable, due to CFS.  State the duration
 ;;        (in months) of this level of restriction and give specific examples
 ;;        of activities that are restricted.
 ;;    2.  State whether there is debilitating fatigue, whether it is constant
 ;;        or nearly so, or if it waxes and wanes.  Does fatigue last 24 hours
 ;;        or longer after exercise?
 ;;    3.  State the total number of days of incapacitating episodes (defined as
 ;;        requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician) due to CFS during the
 ;;        past 12-month period.
 ;;    4.  Describe symptoms of cognitive impairment, such as inability to
 ;;        concentrate, forgetfulness, and confusion, and state their frequency
 ;;        and whether they are constant or nearly so, or if they wax and wane.
 ;;    5.  Describe other current symptoms, such as headaches, sleep disturbance,
 ;;        fever, sore throat, generalized muscle aches or weakness, migratory
 ;;        joint pains, or other neuropsychologic symptoms, and state their
 ;;        frequency and whether they are constant or nearly so, or if they wax
 ;;        and wane.  If headaches are present, are they of a type, severity, or
 ;;        pattern that is different from headaches in the premorbid state?
 ;;    6.  Does the patient require continuous medication for CFS?
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    1.  General appearance.
 ;;    2.  Describe evidence of pharyngitis and enlargement or tenderness of
 ;;        cervical or axillary lymph nodes.
 ;;    3.  Describe other significant abnormal physical findings.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;Signature:                             Date:
