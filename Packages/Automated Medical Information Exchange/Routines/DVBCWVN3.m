 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    1.  For all conditions, comment on:
 ;;
 ;;        a. Course, including onset of disorder, and any injury or
 ;;           surgery (type and when carried out).  Past treatment.
 ;;        b. Current treatment - type, effectiveness, side effects.
 ;;        c. Symptoms.  
 ;;        d. If surgery has been done, report effectiveness and any
 ;;           residual or recurrent symptoms.
 ;;
 ;;    2.  For aortic aneurysm, aneurysm of any large artery, aneurysm of any
 ;;        small artery, arteriovenous fistula, arteriosclerosis obliterans
 ;;        and thromboangiitis obliterans, additionally comment on:
 ;;
 ;;        a. If lower extremities are affected, is there claudication,
 ;;           and, if so, after how many yards of walking on level ground
 ;;           at 2 miles per hour does it develop?  
 ;;        b. Is there pain at rest?
 ;;        c. Is exercise and exertion precluded by the condition?
 ;;  
 ;;    3.  For Raynaud's phenomenon, angioneurotic edema, and erythromelalgia,
 ;;        additionally comment on:
 ;;
 ;;        a. Describe a characteristic attack.
 ;;        b. Record the frequency, duration, and severity of
 ;;           characteristic attacks.
 ;;        c. State each part of the body that is affected.  For
 ;;           angioneurotic edema, state whether laryngeal edema occurs
 ;;           and how frequently.
 ;;
 ;;    4.  For Varicose veins and Post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology,
 ;;        additionally comment on:
 ;;
 ;;        a. Any history of ulcers and aching, fatigue, or abnormal sensations
 ;;           in the leg at rest or after prolonged standing or walking. 
 ;;        b. Are symptoms or edema relieved by elevation of the extremity,
 ;;           compression hosiery, or other measures?  Is edema relieved
 ;;           completely or only partially by elevation of the extremity?
 ;;
 ;;    5.  For soft tissue sarcoma or other malignant neoplasms of vascular
 ;;      origin:
 ;;
 ;;        a. Record date of diagnosis and pathologic diagnosis.
 ;;        b. Record type and dates of treatment.  If treatment has been
 ;;           completed, state date of last treatment.
 ;;        c. If treatment has been completed describe residual or recurrent
 ;;             symptoms.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    1.  For aortic aneurysm, aneurysm of any large artery, aneurysm of any
 ;;        small artery, or arteriovenous fistula:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  State diameter of aneurysm, cardiac status, including heart
 ;;            size and rate.  For arteriovenous fistula, state pulse
 ;;            pressure and whether there is evidence of high output failure.
 ;;        b.  If extremities are affected, describe temperature and color,
 ;;            pulses, trophic changes, ulcers (deep or superficial?), edema,
 ;;            dermatitis, cellulitis.
 ;;        c.  If lower extremities are affected, record ankle/brachial
 ;;            index (using Doppler).
 ;;        d.  If surgery has been carried out, describe residual findings,
 ;;            using appropriate worksheet for the affected body system or
 ;;            organ.
 ;;
 ;;    2.  For arteriosclerosis obliterans and thromboangiitis obliterans:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Describe each affected extremity separately.
 ;;        b.  Record ankle/brachial index (using Doppler).
 ;;        c.  Describe temperature and color of extremities, pulses, trophic
 ;;            changes, ulcers (deep or superficial?).
 ;;        d.  If surgery has been carried out, describe any residuals or
 ;;            side effects of surgery.
 ;;
 ;;    3.  For Raynaud's phenomenon, angioneurotic edema, and erythromelalgia:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Describe ulcers, autoamputations, and any other current findings.
 ;;
 ;;    4.  For Varicose veins and Post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Describe any visible or palpable varicose veins.
 ;;        b.  Describe extent of any ulcers, edema, stasis pigmentation, and
 ;;            eczema.  If edema is present, is it boardlike?  Is it massive?
 ;;            Is it persistent?
 ;;        c.  Describe each affected extremity separately.
 ;;
 ;;    5.  For soft tissue sarcoma or other malignant neoplasms of vascular
 ;;        origin:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Describe all current findings, whether pre- or post-treatment,
 ;;            including any residuals of treatment.  Use other worksheets,
 ;;            if necessary, specific to the affected body system or organs.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Imaging studies, Doppler vascular studies, angiogram, etc., as 
 ;;        appropriate, and if indicated.
 ;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in
