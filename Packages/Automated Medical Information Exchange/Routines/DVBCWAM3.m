 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Describe type of arrhythmia and onset of disorder.  Indicate whether
 ;;        arrhythmia is intermittent or continuous.
 ;;    2.  Describe hospitalization or surgery for arrhythmia, including location,
 ;;        date, type of surgery, reason for hospitalization.
 ;;    3.  For intermittent arrhythmia, state frequency and duration of episodes,
 ;;        and for supraventricular arrhythmia, state how many episodes per year
 ;;        have been confirmed by EKG or Holter monitor?
 ;;    4.  Is a pacemaker present?  If so, when was it inserted, effectiveness,
 ;;        side effects?
 ;;    5.  Is an AICD (automatic implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) present?
 ;;        If so, when was it implanted, effectiveness, side effects?
 ;;    6.  Describe other treatment, including RF (radiofrequency) ablation, type,
 ;;        effectiveness, and side effects?  Is continuous medication required?
 ;;    7.  Is there a history of congestive heart failure?  If so, state whether
 ;;        chronic or not.  If not chronic, how many episodes have there been in
 ;;        the past 12 months?
 ;;    8.  Sustained ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular
 ;;        block, and implantable cardiac pacemakers (if ventricular
 ;;        arrhythmia or atrioventricular block was the reason for the
 ;;        pacemaker) require that the examiner provide the METs level,
 ;;        determined by exercise testing, at which symptoms of dyspnea, 
 ;;        fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope result.
 ;;
 ;;        Exercise testing is not required for these 3 conditions in the
 ;;        following circumstances:
 ;;
 ;;           a.  If exercise testing is medically contraindicated:
 ;;
 ;;               i.  In that case, provide the medical reason exercise
 ;;                   testing cannot be conducted, and
 ;;              ii.  Provide an estimate of the level of activity
 ;;                   (expressed in METs and supported by specific
 ;;                   examples, such as slow stair climbing, or
 ;;                   shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue,
 ;;                   angina, dizziness, or syncope.
 ;;
 ;;           b.  If left ventricular dysfunction is present, and the 
 ;;               ejection fraction is 50 percent or less.
 ;;           c.  If there is chronic congestive heart failure or there
 ;;               has been more than one episode of acute congestive
 ;;               heart failure in the past year.
 ;;           d.  With valvular heart disease - during active infection
 ;;               with valvular heart damage and for three months
 ;;               following cessation of therapy for the active 
 ;;               infection.
 ;;           e.  With endocarditis - for three months following
 ;;               cessation of therapy for active infection with cardiac
 ;;               involvement.
 ;;           f.  With pericarditis - for three months following
 ;;               cessation of therapy for active infection with cardiac
 ;;               involvement.
 ;;           g.  With myocardial infarction - for three months
 ;;               following myocardial infarction.
 ;;           h.  With valve replacement - for six months following date
 ;;               of hospital admission for valve replacement.
 ;;           i.  With coronary bypass surgery - for three months
 ;;               following hospital admission for surgery.
 ;;           j.  For cardiac transplantation - for indefinite period
 ;;               from date of hospital admission for cardiac
 ;;               transplantation.
 ;;           k.  If an exercise test has been done within the past
 ;;               year, the results are of record, and there is no
 ;;               indication that there has been a change in the cardiac
 ;;               status of the veteran since.
 ;;
 ;;    9.  Other significant history.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Vital signs; heart size and method of determination; heart
 ;;        sounds, rate and rhythm, blood pressure.
 ;;    2.  Status of cardiac function - evidence of congestive heart
 ;;        failure.
 ;;    3.  Other significant physical findings.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;  
 ;;    1.  EKG.
 ;;    2.  Was testing for left ventricular function done?  If so,
 ;;        report the ejection fraction.
 ;;    3.  Holter monitor, other tests as indicated.
 ;;    4.  Chest X-ray or other imaging study, exercise stress test,
 ;;        echocardiogram, Holter monitor, thallium study, angiography,
 ;;        etc., as appropriate, and as required or indicated.
 ;;    5.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests
 ;;        conducted in the examination report, including status of
 ;;        left ventricular function, if measured.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;  
 ;;    1.  Type of cardiac arrhythmia, if present.  Confirmed by EKG or
 ;;        Holter monitor?
 ;;    2.  Other diagnoses.
 ;;    3.  Describe the effects of each diagnosed condition on the
 ;;        veteran's usual occupation and daily activities.
