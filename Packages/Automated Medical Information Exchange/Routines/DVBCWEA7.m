 ;;A. Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;B. Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;Review examination.  If this is a review examination for an already service-
 ;;connected eating disorder, provide the medical and occupational history since
 ;;the last medical examination.  Otherwise, follow the history requirements below.
 ;;
 ;;   Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;   1.  Onset.  Date of onset of condition, and circumstances and initial
 ;;       manifestations.
 ;;   2.  Course of condition since onset.
 ;;   3.  Treatment.  Current treatment, response to treatment, and any side
 ;;       effects.
 ;;   4.  Hospitalizations or surgery.  History of related hospitalizations or
 ;;       surgery, dates and locations, if known, reason or type of surgery.
 ;;   5.  State number of hospitalizations required per year for parenteral
 ;;       nutrition or tube feeding.
 ;;   6.  Periods of incapacitation.  State whether there have been periods of
 ;;       incapacitation (requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician) because
 ;;       of an eating disorder.  If so, state the frequency and duration of the
 ;;       episodes (in days) and the total duration of days of incapacitation
 ;;       during the past 12-month period.
 ;;   7.  Binge eating.  State whether there is a history of binge eating.  If
 ;;       there is, state frequency and extent over the past 12-month period.
 ;;   8.  Self-induced vomiting.  State if there is a history of self-induced
 ;;       vomiting or other measure to prevent weight gain when weight is already
 ;;       below expected minimum normal weight.  If so, state frequency and extent
 ;;       over past 12-month period.
 ;;   9.  Other current symptoms.  Report other current (during past 12 months)
 ;;       symptoms of an eating disorder, such as amenorrhea, abdominal pain,
 ;;       lethargy, cold intolerance, disturbance in perception of body shape or
 ;;       size, etc., and other significant history.
 ;;
 ;;C. Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;   Address each of the following and fully describe:
 ;;
 ;;   1.  Weight-related issues.
 ;; 
 ;;       a.  Current weight and height.
 ;;       b.  Expected minimum weight based on age, height, and body build.
 ;;       c.  Pertinent weight history.
 ;;       d.  Percent of weight loss or gain compared to baseline (average weight
 ;;           in the 2 years preceding onset of the condition).
 ;;
 ;;   2.  Other significant findings on physical examination. 
 ;; 
 ;;D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests
 ;;
 ;;   1.  Conduct psychological testing if deemed necessary.
 ;;
 ;;   2.  CBC, blood chemistry, EKG, renal function tests, or other studies, as
 ;;       indicated.
 ;;
 ;;   3.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the 
 ;;       examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E. Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;   1.  State whether the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa
 ;;       have been met.
 ;;   2.  State whether the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa
 ;;       have been met.
 ;;   3.  State whether the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of eating disorder
 ;;       not otherwise specified have been met.
 ;;   4.  State any comments on the DSM-IV criteria.
 ;;   5.  For each diagnosis, state effects of the condition on occupational
 ;;       functioning and daily activities.
 ;;   6.  Capacity to handle financial affairs.  Mental competency, for VA
 ;;       benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to manage
 ;;       VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to any
 ;;       other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes, means
 ;;       that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable of
 ;;       managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In order to
 ;;       assist raters in making a legal determination as to competency, please
 ;;       address the following:
 ;;
 ;;         What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
 ;;         manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
 ;;         things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
 ;;         knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
 ;;         the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the
 ;;         bills himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;         Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
 ;;         of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
 ;;         support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;         If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
 ;;         can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
 ;;         financial affairs, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;Include your name; your credentials, (i.e., board certified psychiatrist,
 ;;licensed psychologist; psychiatry resident or psychology intern,
 ;;LCSW, or NP); and circumstances under which you performed the examination,
 ;;if applicable (i.e., under the close supervision of an attending
 ;;psychiatrist or psychologist); name of supervising psychiatrist or
 ;;psychologist, if applicable.
