 ;;           iv.  If hypertension has not been claimed, take three blood
 ;;                pressure readings on the day of the examination.  If they
 ;;                are suggestive of hypertension or are borderline, readings
 ;;                must be taken two or more times on each of at least two
 ;;                additional days to rule hypertension in or out.
 ;;            v.  In the diagnostic summary, state whether hypertension is
 ;;                ruled in or out after completing these B.P. measurements.
 ;;                If hypertensive heart disease is suspected or found, follow
 ;;                worksheet for Heart.
 ;;
 ;;   14.  ABDOMEN:  Inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion.  
 ;;        Describe any organ enlargement, ventral hernia, mass,
 ;;        tenderness, etc.).  
 ;;
 ;;   15.  GENITAL/RECTAL (MALE):  Inspection and palpation of penis, 
 ;;        testicles, epididymis, and spermatic cord.  If there is a hernia, 
 ;;        describe type, location, size, whether complete, reducible, 
 ;;        recurrent, supported by truss or belt, and whether or not 
 ;;        operable.  Describe anal fissures, hemorrhoids, ulcerations,
 ;;        etc.  Include digital exam of rectal walls and prostate.
 ;;
 ;;   16.  GENITAL/RECTAL (FEMALE):  Pelvic exam, including inspection of
 ;;        introitus, vagina, and cervix, palpation of labia, vagina,
 ;;        cervix, uterus, adnexa, and ovaries, rectal exam.  Do Pap smear
 ;;        if none within past year.  If unable to conduct an examination
 ;;        and Pap smear, or if there is a severe or complex problem
 ;;        refer to a specialist.
 ;;
 ;;   17.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:
 ;;        a. For all joint or muscle disorders, state each muscle and 
 ;;           joint affected.
 ;;
 ;;        b. Separately examine and describe in detail each affected joint.
 ;;           Measure active range of motion in degrees using a goniometer.
 ;;           State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.
 ;;           After 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there
 ;;           are additional limitations of range of motion and whether there
 ;;           is objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most
 ;;           important factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance,
 ;;           incoordination) for any additional loss of motion after
 ;;           repetitive motion.  Report the range of motion after 3
 ;;           repetitions.  (See the appropriate musculoskeletal worksheet for
 ;;           more details.)
 ;;
 ;;        c. Describe swelling, effusion, tenderness, muscle spasm, joint
 ;;           laxity, muscle atrophy, fibrous or bony residual of fracture. If
 ;;           joint is ankylosed, describe the position and angle of fixation.
 ;;
 ;;        d. If foot problems exist, also describe objective evidence of pain
 ;;           at rest and on manipulation, rigidity, spasm, circulatory
 ;;           disturbance, swelling, callus, loss of strength, and whether
 ;;           condition is acquired or congenital.
 ;;
 ;;        e. If there is amputation of a part, see the appropriate worksheet.
 ;;
 ;;        f. With disc disease, also describe any abnormal neurological
 ;;           findings and total duration in days or weeks of incapacitating
 ;;           episodes (an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs
 ;;           and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires
 ;;           bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician).
 ;;
 ;;   18.  ENDOCRINE:  Describe signs and symptoms of any endocrine disease,
 ;;        effects on other body systems.  See endocrine worksheets for further
 ;;        guidance.
 ;;
 ;;   19.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Assess orientation and memory, gait, stance, and
 ;;        coordination, cranial nerve functions.  Assess deep tendon 
 ;;        reflexes, pain, touch, temperature, vibration, and position,
 ;;        motor and sensory status of peripheral nerves.  If neurological
 ;;        abnormalities are found on examination, or there is a history
 ;;        of seizures, refer to appropriate worksheet.
 ;;
 ;;   20.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Describe affect, mood, judgment, behavior, compre-
 ;;        hension of commands, hallucinations or delusions, and intelligence.
 ;;        (This is meant to be a brief screening examination.  If a mental
 ;;        disorder is claimed, or suspected based on the screening, an
 ;;        examination for diagnosis and assessment should be conducted by
 ;;        a psychiatrist or psychologist).
 ;;
 ;;D.  DIAGNOSTIC AND CLINICAL TESTS:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;    2.  Review all test results before providing the summary and diagnosis.
 ;;    3.  Follow additional worksheets, as appropriate.
 ;;    4.  The diagnosis of degenerative or traumatic arthritis of any joint
 ;;        requires X-ray confirmation, but once confirmed by X-ray, either
 ;;        in service or after service, no further X-rays of that joint are
 ;;        required for disability evaluation purposes.
 ;;
 ;;E.  DIAGNOSIS:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Provide a summary list of all disabilities diagnosed.  Include an
 ;;        interpretation of the results of all diagnostic and other tests
 ;;        conducted in the final summary and diagnosis.
 ;;
 ;;    2.  For each condition diagnosed, describe its effect on the veteran's
 ;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
 ;;
 ;;    3.  CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS:  Mental competency, for VA
 ;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
 ;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not
 ;;        to any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
 ;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
 ;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
 ;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
 ;;        competency, please address the following:
 ;;
 ;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
 ;;        to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of
 ;;        such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
 ;;        knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
 ;;        the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay
 ;;        the bills himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
 ;;        capable of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide
 ;;        examples to support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
 ;;        you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
 ;;        or her financial affairs, please explain why.
