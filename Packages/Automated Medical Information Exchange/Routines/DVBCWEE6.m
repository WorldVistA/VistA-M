 ;;Narrative:  An eye examination must be conducted by a licensed optometrist
 ;;or ophthalmologist.  Examinations for the evaluation of visual fields or
 ;;muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication
 ;;of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or
 ;;impaired muscle function.  Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must
 ;;be examined with the claimant's pupils dilated.  The examiner must identify
 ;;the disease, injury, or other pathologic process responsible for any visual
 ;;impairment found.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  General eye symptoms, pain, redness, swelling, discharge, watering, etc.
 ;;    2.  Visual symptoms, including distorted or enlarged image, glare,
 ;;        blurring, haloes, floaters, photophobia, etc.
 ;;    3.  Current ophthalmologic treatment, side effects.  State whether
 ;;        continuous medication is required.
 ;;    4.  For neoplasms, state date of diagnosis, exact diagnosis, whether
 ;;        benign or malignant, types and dates of treatment, and date of last
 ;;        treatment.
 ;;    5.  History of hospitalization or surgery, dates and location if known,
 ;;        reason or type of surgery.
 ;;    6.  For trauma, type of injury, cause, eye injured, and date.
 ;;    7.  Report any incapacitating episodes due to eye diseases such as
 ;;        angle-closure glaucoma, choroidopathy (including uveitis, iritis,
 ;;        cyclitis, and choroiditis), keratopathy, scleritis, retinopathy or
 ;;        maculopathy, intraocular hemorrhage, detachment of retina, or unhealed
 ;;        eye injury.  List each incapacitating episode, if any, during the past
 ;;        12-month period, its duration in days, and the cause of the episode
 ;;        of incapacitation.  Note:  An incapacitating episode is a period of
 ;;        acute symptoms severe enough to require bed rest and treatment by a
 ;;        physician or other healthcare provider.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    Address each of the following, as applicable, and fully describe 
 ;;    current findings:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Visual Acuity:
 ;;        a. Examination of visual acuity must include the central
 ;;           uncorrected and its equivalent corrected visual acuity for distance
 ;;           and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent.
 ;;           Evaluate central visual acuity on the basis of corrected distance
 ;;           vision with central fixation, even if a central scotoma is present.
 ;;           Examine each eye independently and record the refractive information
 ;;           indicated below.
 ;;        b. Use Snellen's test type or its equivalent for distance and revised
 ;;           Jaegar Standard or its equivalent for near.
 ;;        c. Provided that he or she customarily wears contact lenses, determine
 ;;           the visual acuity of any individual affected by a corneal disorder
 ;;           that results in severe irregular astigmatism (including keratoconus)
 ;;           that can be improved more by contact lenses than by eyeglass lenses,
 ;;           as corrected by contact lenses.
 ;;        d. For visual acuity worse than 5/200 in either or both eyes, report
 ;;           the distance in feet/inches (or meters/centimeters) from the face at
 ;;           which the veteran can count fingers/detect hand motion/read the
 ;;           largest line on the chart.  If the veteran cannot detect hand
 ;;           motion or count fingers at any distance, state whether he or she has
 ;;           light perception.
 ;;        e. Does the lens required to correct distance vision in the poorer eye
 ;;           differ by more than three diopters from the lens required to correct
 ;;           distance vision in the better eye?  If so, explain the reason for
 ;;           the difference.
 ;;        f. Is there a difference equal to two or more scheduled steps or lines
 ;;           of visual acuity between near and distance corrected vision for
 ;;           either eye, with the near vision being worse?  If so, include at
 ;;           least two recordings of near and distance corrected vision and an
 ;;           explanation of the reason for the difference.
 ;;
 ;;                  Right Eye                FAR            NEAR
 ;;
 ;;           RIGHT EYE     Uncorrected    __________      _________
 ;;
 ;;           RIGHT EYE     CORRECTED      __________      _________
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;                  Left Eye                 FAR            NEAR
 ;;
 ;;           LEFT EYE      Uncorrected    __________      _________
 ;;
 ;;           LEFT EYE      CORRECTED      __________      _________
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;    2.  Muscle function examination:
 ;;        a. Use a Goldmann perimeter chart that identifies the four major
 ;;           quadrants (upward, downward, left and right lateral) and the
 ;;           central field (20 degrees or less) and chart the areas of diplopia.
 ;;           Include the plotted chart with the examination report.  Indicate on
 ;;           the chart whether or not diplopia is present in the following areas:
 ;;
 ;;           Central 20 degrees
 ;;           21 to 30 degrees
 ;;                    Down
 ;;                    Left lateral
 ;;                    Right lateral
 ;;                    Up
 ;;           31 to 40 degrees
 ;;                    Down
 ;;                    Left lateral
 ;;                    Right lateral
 ;;                    Up
 ;;
 ;;        b. State whether diplopia occurs occasionally or more than
 ;;           occasionally.
 ;;        c. State whether or not diplopia is correctable with spectacles.
 ;;
 ;;    NOTE: Procedure for using Goldmann perimeter to assess diplopia field.
 ;;    1) Both eyes are open and the device is centered between the eyes.
 ;;    2) The patient's attention is directed towards a III/4e target while both
 ;;    eyes are open and fixating on the target.
 ;;    3) The patient maintains attention to the target while it is moved.  Areas
 ;;    of diplopia are identified on the VF paper.
 ;;
 ;;    3. Visual Field Examination:
 ;;       a. Use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using
 ;;          Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these
 ;;          perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing
 ;;          capability.
 ;;       b. For phakic (normal) individuals, as well as for pseudophakic or
 ;;          aphakic individuals who are well adapted to intraocular lens implant
 ;;          or contact lens correction, visual field examinations must be 
 ;;          conducted using a standard target size and luminance, which is
 ;;          Goldmann's equivalent III/4e.
 ;;       c. For aphakic individuals not well adapted to contact lens correction
 ;;          or pseudophakic individuals not well adapted to intraocular lens
 ;;          implant, visual field examinations must be conducted using Goldmann's
 ;;          equivalent IV/4e.
 ;;       d. In all cases, record the results on a standard Goldmann chart, and
 ;;          include the Goldmann chart with the examination report.  Chart at
 ;;          least 16 meridians 22 1/2 degrees apart for each eye and indicate
 ;;          the Goldmann equivalent used.
 ;;       e. If additional testing is necessary to evaluate visual fields,
 ;;          conduct the additional testing using either a tangent screen or a
 ;;          30-degree threshold visual field with the Goldmann III stimulus size.
 ;;          Include the tracing of either the tangent screen or of the 30-degree
 ;;          threshold visual field with the Goldmann III stimulus size in the
 ;;          examination report.
 ;;       f. Plot all scotomas carefully in order to allow measurements to be made
 ;;          for adjustments in the calculation of visual field defects.
 ;;
 ;;    4. Provide details of eye disease or injury (including eyebrows, 
 ;;       eyelashes, eyelids, lacrimal duct) other than loss of visual acuity,
 ;;       diplopia, or visual field defect.
 ;;    5. If there is enucleation, can a prosthesis be worn? 
 ;;    6. If nystagmus is present, state whether it is the central type.
 ;;    7. Has a lens been removed?  If so, state whether an intraocular lens
 ;;       replacement (implant) is present.
 ;;    8. If chronic conjunctivitis is present, is it active (with objective
 ;;       findings, such as red, thick conjunctivae, mucous secretion, etc.) or
 ;;       inactive?
 ;;    9. Report results of tonometry.
 ;;   10. Report results of slit lamp biomicroscopic examination.
 ;;   11. For ocular funduscopic retinal examination, report any abnormality of
 ;;       optic nerve, vessels, macula, etc.
 ;;   12. Report any other abnormalities noted.
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:  (Other than for visual acuity, 
 ;;    diplopia, and visual fields, as described above.)
 ;;    1. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the 
 ;;       examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Describe the effects of the condition(s) on the veteran's usual
 ;;        occupation and daily activities.
