 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Describe date of onset, circumstances, and initial manifestations of
 ;;        the disease or injury.  Report course of condition.
 ;;    2.  For osteomyelitis:  location(s), frequency and dates of episodes of
 ;;        active infection.  Were there constitutional symptoms with episodes of
 ;;        active infection?  Is there current active infection?  If not, name
 ;;        year of last active infection and how the infection was confirmed.
 ;;    3.  History of hospitalizations or surgery, reason or type of surgery,
 ;;        location and dates, if known.
 ;;    4.  Symptoms of pain (location), weakness, stiffness, swelling, heat,
 ;;        redness, drainage, fever, debility, instability or giving way,
 ;;        "locking," abnormal motion, etc.  If motion of a joint is affected,
 ;;        follow the JOINTS examination worksheet.       
 ;;    5.  Hand dominance and how determined.
 ;;    6.  Describe current treatment:  type, response, and side effects.
 ;;    7.  If there are periods of flare-up of bone disease:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  State their severity, frequency, and duration.
 ;;        b.  Name the precipitating and alleviating factors.
 ;;        c.  Estimate to what extent, if any, per veteran, they affect
 ;;            functional impairment during the flare-up.
 ;;
 ;;    8.  Describe whether crutches, brace, cane, walker, etc., are needed
 ;;        to assist walking.
 ;;    9.  History of neoplasm.
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Date of diagnosis, exact diagnosis.
 ;;        b.  Benign or malignant.
 ;;        c.  Type of treatment, dates.
 ;;        d.  Last date of treatment.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;     Address each of the following as appropriate to the disability 
 ;;     being examined and fully describe current findings:
 ;;
 ;;     1.  Describe objective evidence of deformity, angulation, loss of a
 ;;         bone or part of a bone, malunion, nonunion, loose motion, false
 ;;         joint, etc.
 ;;     2.  For infection, describe tenderness, drainage, edema, effusion,
 ;;         painful motion, intra-articular involvement, weakness, redness, heat.
 ;;     3.  With joint involvement, a detailed assessment of each affected joint
 ;;         is required.  Follow the JOINTS worksheet.
 ;;     4.  For weight bearing joints (hip, knee, ankle), describe gait
 ;;         and functional limitations on standing (in minutes or hours) and
 ;;         walking (in yards or miles).  Describe any callosities, areas of
 ;;         breakdown, or unusual shoe wear pattern that would indicate abnormal
 ;;         weight bearing.
 ;;     5.  If ankylosis is present, follow the JOINTS worksheet.
 ;;     6.  If shortening of the leg may be present, measure the leg length
 ;;         bilaterally from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial
 ;;         malleolus.
 ;;     7.  Are there constitutional signs of bone disease - anemia, weight loss,
 ;;         fever, debility, amyloid liver, etc.?
 ;;     8.  For genu recurvatum, acquired, traumatic:  Is there objective evidence
 ;;         of weakness and insecurity on weight-bearing?
 ;;     9.  For malunion of os calcis or astralgus - state degree of deformity
 ;;         (mild, moderate, marked).
 ;;     10. For a bone neoplasm, describe residuals of the neoplasm and its
 ;;         treatment.
 ;;
 ;;D.   Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;     1.  As indicated:  X-rays, including special views or weight 
 ;;         bearing films, MRI, arthrogram, diagnostic arthroscopy.  
 ;;         NOTE:  The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis or post-traumatic
 ;;         arthritis of a joint requires X-ray confirmation.  Once the 
 ;;         diagnosis has been confirmed in a joint, further X-rays of that 
 ;;         joint are not required.
 ;;     2.  For osteomyelitis, state presence and location of any involucrum,
 ;;         sequestrum, or draining sinus.
 ;;     3.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests 
 ;;         conducted in the examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;     1.  Describe the effects of the condition on the veteran's usual
 ;;         occupation and daily activities.
