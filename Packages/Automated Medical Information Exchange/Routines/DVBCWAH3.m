 ;;        other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefit purposes, means
 ;;        that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable of
 ;;        managing benefit payments in his or her best interest.  In order to
 ;;        assist raters in making a legal determination as to competency, please
 ;;        address the following:
 ;;
 ;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
 ;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
 ;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
 ;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
 ;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
 ;;        himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
 ;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
 ;;        support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
 ;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
 ;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
