 ;;=The form will invoke the proper interface routines by doing a lookup on
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",7,0)
 ;;=this file and then invoking the routine by indirection. The INPUT VARIABLE
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",8,0)
 ;;=fields are for documentation purposes and to verify that the proper
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",9,0)
 ;;=variables are defined. Data will be exchanged between the encounter form
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",10,0)
 ;;=utilities and other packages by putting the data in a predefined location.
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",11,0)

 ;;=Interface. For single valued data and record valued data there is no

 ;;=additional subscript level, the number of the item on the list. For
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",17,0)
 ;;=word processing type data the data will be in FM word-processing format,
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",18,0)

 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",19,0)
 ;;=these items of data can have its own entry in the Package Interface file,
 ;;^DIC(358.6,"%D",20,0)
