 ;;
 ;;Narrative:  An examination of hearing impairment must be conducted by a
 ;;state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech
 ;;discrimination test (specifically, the Maryland CNC recording) and a
 ;;pure tone audiometry test in a sound isolated booth that meets American
 ;;National Standards Institute standards (ANSI S3.1.1991) for ambient noise.
 ;;Measurements will be reported at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,
 ;;and 4000 Hz.  The examination will include the following tests: Pure tone
 ;;audiometry by air conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and
 ;;8000 Hz, and by bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and
 ;;4000 Hz, spondee thresholds, speech recognition using the recorded
 ;;Maryland CNC Test, tympanometry and acoustic reflex tests, and, when
 ;;necessary, Stenger tests.  Bone conduction thresholds are measured 
 ;;when the air conduction thresholds are poorer than 15 dB HL.  A modified
 ;;Hughson-Westlake procedure will be used with appropriate masking.  A
 ;;Stenger must be administered whenever pure tone air conduction
 ;;thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz differ by 20 dB or more
 ;;between the two ears.  Maximum speech recognition will be reported with
 ;;the 50 word VA approved recording of the Maryland CNC test.  The starting
 ;;presentation level will be 40dB re SRT.  If necessary, the starting level
 ;;will be adjusted upward to obtain a level at least 5 dB above the threshold
 ;;at 2000 Hz, if not above the patient's tolerance level.  The examination
 ;;will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.  Both ears must be
 ;;examined for hearing impairment even if hearing loss in only one ear is
 ;;at issue.
 ;;
 ;;   When speech recognition is 92% or less, a performance intensity
 ;;   function must be obtained.
 ;;
 ;;Procedures for Obtaining a Modified Performance-Intensity Function
 ;;   1.  The starting level is 40 dB re: SRT (speech reception threshold).
 ;;   The starting level will be adjusted upward to obtain a level at least
 ;;   5 dB above the threshold at 2000 Hz, if not above the patient's
 ;;   tolerance level.
 ;;   2.  Present 25 words at 6 dB above and 6 dB below the starting level.
 ;;   3.  If recognition performance improves less than 6%, then maximum word
 ;;   recognition performance has been obtained.
 ;;       Example:  starting level=50 dB HL.  Initial performance=80%.
 ;;       Decrease level to 44 dB HL.  Performance decreases to 76%.  Increase
 ;;       level to 56 dB HL.  Performance increases to 84%.  Test level for
 ;;       full list=50 dB HL.
 ;;   4.  If performance improves by 6% or more at the first 6-dB increment,
 ;;   then word recognition is measured using another 25 words at an
 ;;   additional 6-dB increment.
 ;;       Example:  starting level=50 dB HL.  Initial performance=80%.
 ;;       Increase level to 56 dB HL.  Performance improves to 88% (+8%).
 ;;       Increase level to 62 dB HL.  Performance decreases to 84% (-4%).
 ;;       Test level for full list=56 dB HL.
 ;;   5.  A full list (50 words) is then presented at the level of maximum
 ;;   performance.  The word recognition performance at this level is reported
 ;;   as the speech recognition score.  Only the best performance for a full
 ;;   list (50 words) will be reported.
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records: Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;      Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;        1.  Chief complaint.
 ;;        2.  Effects of the condition on occupational functioning and daily
 ;;            activities.
 ;;        3.  Pertinent service history.
 ;;        4.  History of military, occupational, and recreational noise
 ;;            exposure.
 ;;        5.  Pertinent family and social history; history of ear disease,
 ;;            head or ear trauma, etc.
 ;;        6.  Tinnitus.
 ;;
 ;;              a.  Is there a claim for tinnitus (verify from examination
 ;;                  request, i.e., 2507)?  (yes/no)
 ;;              b.  Is there a current complaint of tinnitus? (yes/no)  If yes
 ;;                  answer the following questions whether or not the condition
 ;;                  is claimed.
 ;;              c.  Date and circumstances of onset.
 ;;              d.  Whether it is constant or recurrent (intermittent). 
 ;;                  Current complaints only.
 ;;              e.  If there is a claim and no current complaint, the
 ;;                  audiologist must:
 ;;
 ;;                  State when veteran last experienced tinnitus.
 ;;
 ;;                  Describe the tinnitus experienced at that time.
 ;;
 ;;                  Describe intervening course between onset and last episode,
 ;;                  e.g., how frequently in a year does a veteran experience
 ;;                  tinnitus.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Measure and record puretone thresholds in decibels at the indicated
 ;;        frequencies (air conduction):
 ;;
 ;;    = = = = =RIGHT EAR= = = = = = = = = = = = = LEFT EAR = = = = = = 
 ;;    A*    B    C    D    E    **       A*   B    C   D    E     **
 ;;    500|1000|2000|3000|4000|average   500|1000|2000|3000|4000|average
 ;;       |    |    |    |    |             |    |    |    |    |
 ;;  
 ;;    *  The puretone threshold at 500 Hz is not used in calculating the
 ;;       puretone threshold average for evaluation purposes but is used in
 ;;       determining whether or not, for VA purposes, a hearing impairment
 ;;       reaches the level of a disability.  Puretone thresholds should not
 ;;       exceed 105 decibels or the tolerance level.
 ;;    ** The average of B, C, D, and E.
 ;;
 ;;    2.  Speech Recognition Score: Maryland CNC word list
 ;;
 ;;                         _____% right ear _____% left ear.
 ;;
 ;;    When only puretone results should be used to evaluate hearing loss, 
 ;;    the examiner, who must be a state-licensed audiologist, should certify
 ;;    that language difficulties or other problems (specify what the problems
 ;;    are) make the combined use of puretone average and speech
 ;;    discrimination inappropriate.
 ;;
 ;;    Thresholds should not exceed 100 decibels or the tolerance level.
 ;;
 ;;    Pausing:  Examiners should pause when necessary during speech
 ;;    recognition tests, in order to give the veteran sufficient time to
 ;;    respond.  This will ensure that the test results are based on actual
 ;;    hearing loss rather than on the effects of other problems that might
 ;;    slow a veteran's response.  There are a variety of problems that might
 ;;    require pausing, for example, the presence of cognitive impairment.  It
 ;;    is up to the examiner to determine when to use pausing and the length
 ;;    of the pauses.
 ;;
 ;;    Need for a modified performance-intensity function:  The normal speech
 ;;    recognition performance is 94% or better for a full (50 word) list.  If
 ;;    speech recognition is worse than 94% after presentation of a full list,
 ;;    then a modified performance-intensity function must be obtained to
 ;;    determine best performance (see Narrative for description of procedures).
 ;;
 ;;When describing speech recognition performance, use these terms:
 ;;
 ;;     Percent        Correct Description
 ;;     100-94%        Excellent (Normal)
 ;;     92-80%         Good
 ;;     78-70%         Fair
 ;;     Less than 70%  Poor
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Report middle ear status, confirm type of loss and indicate need
 ;;        for medical follow-up.  In cases where there is poor inter-test
 ;;        reliability and/or positive Stenger test results, obtain and report
 ;;        estimates of hearing thresholds using a combination of behavioral
 ;;        testing, Stenger interference levels, and electrophysiological
 ;;        tests.
 ;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;
 ;;E.  Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Summary of audiologic test results.  Indicate type and degree 
 ;;        of hearing loss for the frequency range from 500 to 4000 Hz.
 ;;        For type of loss, indicate whether it is normal, conductive,
 ;;        sensorineural, central, or mixed.  For degree, indicate whether
 ;;        it is mild (26-40 HL), moderate (41-54 HL), moderately severe 
 ;;        (55-69 HL), severe (70-89 HL), or profound (90+ HL).
 ;;
 ;;    [For VA purposes, impaired hearing is considered to be a disability
 ;;    when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000,
 ;;    3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds
 ;;    for at least three of these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when
 ;;    speech recognition scores are less than 94%]
 ;;
 ;;    2.  Note whether, based on audiologic results, medical follow-up
 ;;        is needed for an ear or hearing problem, and whether there is
 ;;        a problem that, if treated, might cause a change in hearing 
 ;;        threshold levels.
 ;;
 ;;    3.  If there is a current complaint of tinnitus, indicate whether or not
 ;;        tinnitus is as likely as not a symptom associated with hearing loss,
 ;;        if hearing loss is present.  If there is no hearing loss present;
 ;;        or the audiologist determines that it is as likely as not that
 ;;        tinnitus is associated with another medical condition; or the
 ;;        etiology of tinnitus cannot be determined on the basis of available
 ;;        information without resorting to speculation, so state.  The VBA
 ;;        regional office will then determine whether further non-audiological
 ;;        examination is needed, based on their review of all evidence of
 ;;        record.
