 ;;A. Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B. Present Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;Please comment on whether the etiology for any of these subjective complaints
 ;;is unrelated to the claimed disability.
 ;;
 ;;   1.  Provide date, circumstances of onset and course since onset.
 ;;   2.  Report complaints of pain (including any radiation).
 ;;
 ;;       a.  Onset, description of pain.
 ;;       b.  Location and distribution 
 ;;       c.  Duration, frequency.

 ;;       e.  Have there been incapacitating episodes of back pain in the 
 ;;           past 12 months?  Duration?  (Incapacitating episodes are episodes
 ;;           that require bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by

 ;;
 ;;       a.  Severity, frequency, and duration. 
 ;;       b.  Precipitating and alleviating factors. 
 ;;       c.  Additional limitation of motion or functional impairment during
 ;;           the flare-up.
 ;;
 ;;   5.  Describe associated features or symptoms (e.g., stiffness, fatigue,
 ;;       spasms, weakness, decreased motion, numbness, paresthesias, leg or
 ;;       foot weakness, bladder complaints (i.e., urinary incontinence (how
 ;;       treated, appliance, absorbent material, number of times changed per
 ;;       24 hours), urgency, retention (require catheterization), frequency
 ;;       (daytime voiding interval, nocturia)), bowel complaints (i.e.,

 ;;
 ;;C. Physical Examination (Objective Findings): Address each of the following as 
 ;;   appropriate to the condition being examined and fully describe current
 ;;   findings:
 ;; 
 ;;   1.  Inspection: spine, limbs, posture and gait, position of the head,
 ;;       curvatures of the spine, symmetry in appearance.
 ;;
 ;;   2.  Range of motion
 ;;
 ;;       a.  Cervical Spine 
 ;;
 ;;           The reproducibility of an individual's range of motion is one
 ;;           indicator of optimum effort. Pain, fear of injury, disuse or
 ;;           neuromuscular inhibition may limit mobility by decreasing the
 ;;           individual's effort. If range of motion measurements fail to
 ;;           match known pathology, please repeat the measurements.
 ;;           (Reference: Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,
 ;;           Fifth Edition, 2001, page 399).
 ;;
 ;;           i. Using a goniometer, measure and report the range of motion in
 ;;              degrees of forward flexion, extension, left lateral flexion,
 ;;              right lateral flexion, left lateral rotation and right lateral
 ;;              rotation. Generally, the normal ranges of motion for the
 ;;              cervical spine are as follows:
 ;;
 ;;              -Forward flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
 ;;              -Extension: 0 to 45 degrees 
 ;;              -Left Lateral Flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
 ;;              -Right Lateral Flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
 ;;              -Left Lateral Rotation: 0 to 80 degrees 
 ;;              -Right Lateral Rotation: 0 to 80 degrees
 ;;
 ;;           There may be a situation where an individual's range of motion is
 ;;           reduced, but "normal" (in the examiner's opinion) based on the
 ;;           individual's age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other
 ;;           factors unrelated to the disability for which the exam is being
 ;;           performed. In this situation, please explain why the individual's
 ;;           measured range of motion should be considered as "normal".
 ;;
 ;;           
 ;;          ii. Describe presence or absence of objective evidence of pain.
 ;;
 ;;         iii. Describe objective evidence of painful motion, spasm, weakness,
 ;;              tenderness, atrophy, guarding, etc.
 ;; 
 ;;          iv. Describe any postural abnormalities, fixed deformity
 ;;              (ankylosis), or abnormality of musculature of cervical spine
 ;;              musculature.
 ;;
 ;;       b. Thoracolumbar spine 
 ;;
 ;;          The reproducibility of an individual's range of motion is one
 ;;          indicator of optimum effort. Pain, fear of injury, disuse or
 ;;          neuromuscular inhibition may limit mobility by decreasing the
 ;;          individual's effort. If range of motion measurements fail to
 ;;          match known pathology, please repeat the measurements.
 ;;          (Reference: Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,
 ;;          Fifth Edition, 2001, page 399).
 ;; 
 ;;          It is best to measure range of motion for the thoracolumbar
 ;;          spine from a standing position. Measuring the range of motion
 ;;          from a standing position (as opposed to from a sitting position)
 ;;          will include the effects of forces generated by the distance
 ;;          from the center of gravity from the axis of motion of the spine
 ;;          and will include the effect of contraction of the spinal
 ;;          muscles. Contraction of the spinal muscles imposes a significant
 ;;          compressive force during spine movements upon the lumbar discs.
 ;;
 ;;          i. Provide forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine as a unit.
 ;;             Do not include hip flexion. (See Magee, Orthopedic Physical
 ;;             Assessment, Third Edition, 1997, W.B. Saunders Company,
 ;;             pages 374-75). Using a goniometer, measure and report the range
 ;;             of motion in degrees for forward flexion, extension, left 
 ;;             lateral flexion, right lateral flexion, left lateral rotation
 ;;             and right lateral rotation. Generally, the normal ranges of 
 ;;             motion for the thoracolumbar spine as a unit are as follows:
 ;;
 ;;             -Forward flexion: 0 to 90 degrees 
 ;;             -Extension: 0 to 30 degrees 
 ;;             -Left Lateral Flexion: 0 to 30 degrees 
 ;;             -Right Lateral Flexion: 0 to 30 degrees 
 ;;             -Left Lateral Rotation: 0 to 30 degrees 
 ;;             -Right Lateral Rotation: 0 to 30 degrees
 ;;
 ;;           There may be a situation where an individual's range of motion is
 ;;           reduced, but "normal" (in the examiner's opinion) based on the
 ;;           individual's age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other
 ;;           factors unrelated to the disability for which the exam is being
 ;;           performed. In this situation, please explain why the individual's
 ;;           measured range of motion should be considered as "normal".
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;          ii. Describe presence or absence of objective evidence of pain.
 ;;
 ;;         iii. Describe objective evidence of painful motion, spasm, weakness,
 ;;              tenderness, atrophy, guarding, etc.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;              a. Indicate whether there is muscle spasm, guarding or localized
 ;;                 tenderness with preserved spinal contour, and normal gait.
 ;;
 ;;              b. Indicate whether there is muscle spasm, or guarding severe
 ;;                 enough to result in an abnormal gait, abnormal spinal contour
 ;;                 such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis or abnormal kyphosis.
 ;;
 ;;          iv. Describe any postural abnormalities, fixed deformity (ankylosis), 
 ;;                  or abnormality of musculature of back.
