 ;;   11. Endocrine dysfunction.  If evidence of endocrine dysfunction is
 ;;       identified or suspected, select and follow the additional appropriate
 ;;       examination protocol for the type of endocrine disorder identified.
 ;;   12. Autonomic dysfunction.  Report any symptoms of autonomic dysfunction,
 ;;       such as heat intolerance, excess or decreased sweating, etc.
 ;;   13. Other abnormal physical findings.
 ;;   14. Assessment of cognitive impairment and other residuals of TBI not
 ;;       otherwise classified:
 ;;    
 ;;Instruction:  Answer the following specific questions about each of the
 ;;following items (after completion of neuropsychological testing, if done).
 ;;State on the examination report which of the choices best describes each of
 ;;the items.  Do not report by using the number of the item or the letter of
 ;;the description.  Report the title of the item:  "Memory, attention,
 ;;concentration, executive functions," etc., and then state the correct
 ;;description, e.g., "There is objective evidence on testing of mild impairment
 ;;of memory (and/or attention, and/or concentration, and/or executive functions)
 ;;resulting in mild functional impairment."
 ;;
 ;;   I. Memory, attention, concentration, executive functions
 ;;      a. No complaints of impairment of memory, attention, concentration or
 ;;      executive functions.
 ;;      b. A complaint of mild memory loss (such as having difficulty following
 ;;      a conversation, recalling recent conversations, remembering names of new
 ;;      acquaintances, or finding words, or often misplacing items), attention,
 ;;      concentration, or executive functions, but without objective evidence
 ;;      on testing.
 ;;      c. Objective evidence on testing of mild impairment of memory,
 ;;      attention, concentration, or executive functions resulting in mild
 ;;      functional impairment.
 ;;      d. Objective evidence on testing of moderate impairment of memory,
 ;;      attention, concentration, or executive functions resulting in moderate
 ;;      functional impairment.
 ;;      e. Objective evidence on testing of severe impairment of memory,
 ;;      attention, concentration, or executive functions resulting in severe
 ;;      functional impairment.
 ;;
 ;;  II. Judgment
 ;;      a. Normal.
 ;;      b. Mildly impaired judgment.  For complex or unfamiliar decisions,
 ;;      occasionally unable to identify, understand, and weigh the alternatives,
 ;;      understand the consequences of choices, and make a reasonable decision.
 ;;      c. Moderately impaired judgment.  For complex or unfamiliar decisions,
 ;;      usually unable to identify, understand, and weigh the alternatives,
 ;;      understand the consequences of choices, and make a reasonable decision,
 ;;      although has little difficulty with simple decisions.
 ;;      d. Moderately severely impaired judgment.  For even routine and familiar
 ;;      decisions, occasionally unable to identify, understand, and weigh the
 ;;      alternatives, understand the consequences of choices, and make a 
 ;;      reasonable decision.
 ;;      e. Severely impaired judgment.  For even routine and familiar decisions,
 ;;      usually unable to identify, understand, and weigh the alternatives,
 ;;      understand the consequences of choices, and make a reasonable decision.
 ;;      For example, unable to determine appropriate clothing for current
 ;;      weather conditions or judge when to avoid dangerous situations or
 ;;      activities.
 ;;
 ;; III. Social Interaction
 ;;      a. Social interaction is routinely appropriate.
 ;;      b. Social interaction is occasionally inappropriate.
 ;;      c. Social interaction is frequently inappropriate.
 ;;      d. Social interaction is inappropriate most or all of the time.
 ;;
 ;;  IV. Orientation
 ;;      a. Always oriented to person, time, place, and situation.
 ;;      b. Occasionally disoriented to one of the four aspects (person, time,
 ;;      place, situation) of orientation.
 ;;      c. Occasionally disoriented to two of the four aspects (person, time,
 ;;      place, situation) of orientation or often disoriented to one aspect of
 ;;      orientation.
 ;;      d. Often disoriented to two or more of the four aspects (person, time,
 ;;      place, situation) of orientation.
 ;;      e. Consistently disoriented to two or more of the four aspects (person,
 ;;      time, place, situation) of orientation.
 ;;
 ;;   V. Motor activity (with intact motor and sensory system)
 ;;      a. Motor activity normal.
 ;;      b. Motor activity normal most of the time, but mildly slowed at times
 ;;      due to apraxia (inability to perform previously learned motor activities,
 ;;      despite normal motor function).
 ;;      c. Motor activity mildly decreased or with moderate slowing due to
 ;;      apraxia.
 ;;      d. Motor activity moderately decreased due to apraxia.
 ;;      e. Motor activity severely decreased due to apraxia.
 ;;
 ;;  VI. Visual spatial orientation
 ;;      a. Normal.
 ;;      b. Mildly impaired.  Occasionally gets lost in unfamiliar surroundings,
 ;;      has difficulty reading maps or following directions.  Is able to use
 ;;      assistive devices such as GPS (global positioning system).
 ;;      c. Moderately impaired.  Usually gets lost in unfamiliar surroundings,
 ;;      has difficulty reading maps, following directions, and judging distance.
 ;;      Has difficulty using assistive devices such as GPS (global positioning
 ;;      system).
 ;;      d. Moderately severely impaired.  Gets lost even in familiar
 ;;      surroundings, unable to use assistive devices such as GPS (global
 ;;      positioning system).
 ;;      e. Severely impaired.  May be unable to touch or name own body parts
 ;;      when asked by the examiner, identify the relative position in space of
 ;;      two different objects, or find the way from one room to another in a 
 ;;      familiar environment.
 ;;
 ;; VII. Subjective symptoms
 ;;      a. Subjective symptoms that do not interfere with work; instrumental

 ;;      relationships.  Examples are:  mild or occasional headaches, mild
 ;;      anxiety.
 ;;      b. Three or more subjective symptoms that mildly interfere with work;
 ;;      instrumental activities of daily living; or work, family, or other
 ;;      close relationships.  Examples of findings that might be seen at this
 ;;      level of impairment are:  intermittent dizziness, daily mild to moderate
 ;;      headaches, tinnitus, frequent insomnia, hypersensitivity to sound,
 ;;      hypersensitivity to light.

 ;;      level of impairment are:  marked fatigability, blurred or double vision,
 ;;      headaches requiring rest periods during most days.
 ;;

 ;;      unpredictability, lack of motivation, verbal aggression, physical
 ;;      aggression, belligerence, apathy, lack of empathy, moodiness, lack of
 ;;      cooperation, inflexibility, and impaired awareness of disability.  Any
 ;;      of these effects may range from slight to severe, although verbal and
 ;;      physical aggression are likely to have a more serious impact on
 ;;      workplace interaction and social interaction than some of the other
 ;;      effects.
 ;;      b. One or more neurobehavioral effects that occasionally interfere with
 ;;      workplace interaction, social interaction, or both but do not preclude
 ;;      them.
 ;;      c. One or more neurobehavioral effects that frequently interfere with
 ;;      workplace interaction, social interaction, or both but do not preclude
 ;;      them.
 ;;      d. One or more neurobehavioral effects that interfere with or preclude
 ;;      workplace interaction, social interaction, or both on most days or that
 ;;      occasionally require supervision for safety of self or others.

 ;;      alternative modes of communication.  Able to communicate basic needs.
